Before that, as a programmer, he coded compiler code generators, was awarded patents for compression and security algorithms he designed and coded for embedded microcontroller devices, wrote two widely used programming texts, and developed the computer animation demo that Apple used to launch and sell a next-generation line of PCs. The primary focus of his consulting practice has mirrored what he did as a manager: untangling the knots in software development. As Ron Lichty Consulting, he takes on fractional Interim VP Engineering and Acting CTO roles, trains teams in scrum, transitions teams to agile, trains managers in managing software people and teams, and advises organizations and coaches teams to make their software development “hum.” His 450-page book, Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams, was recently released as video training - LiveLessons: Managing Software People and Teams - both from Pearson and on O’Reilly’s Safari Network. He also co-authors the biannual Study of Product Team Performance.\n \n\nFollow Mickey W. Mantle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mwmantleCA\n\nSpeaker Biography for Mickey W. Mantle\n\nMickey has been developing software systems and products for over 40 years, as a systems programmer, Tech Lead, Manager, VP Engineering, CTO, COO, and now CEO/CTO of his own company.  During this time he has contributed to several notable companies, including computer graphics pioneer Evans & Sutherland (E&S), Pixar, Broderbund Software, and Gracenote – always in a technical leadership role.\n\nHe continues developing software at Wanderful (see wanderfulstorybooks.com), developing and publishing Apps for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.\n\nWorking with co-author Ron Lichty, they wrote the book “Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams”. Published by Addison Wesley, this book distills their experience of over 70 combined years developing software and managing programmers and has received many accolades including being favorably compared to The Mythical Man Month and Peopleware (see managingtheunmanageable.net).\n \n\nFollow Tammy Baker on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tammybaker123\n\nSpeaker Biography for Tammy Baker\n\nTammy has held a number of executive and management roles over the past 15 years, including vice president of engineering Cantaloupe Systems, vice president of engineering at Untangle, Inc., and vice president of engineering at E-Color. More recently, Tammy is vice president of engineering and CSO for Cantaloupe Systems which was recently acquired by USA Technologies.",

            "description": "Ron Lichty, Mickey W. Mantle, Tammy Baker Talk about 'Ask the Expert: Q&A with Engineering Managers' at https://SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com in San Jose Hosted by PayPal\n\nHow do I handle an unreasonable boss? What if I don't trust my team to deliver good code?  \nIn this unscripted format, speakers from the Management and Agile tracks answer your questions about challenges leading programmers.\n\nSession Details:\nhttps://SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com/Session/2018/ask-the-expert-qa-with-engineering-managers\n\n\nSilicon Valley Code Camp site:\nhttps://SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com\n\nSubscribe to the Silicon Valley Code Camp Youtube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SiliconValleyCodeCampVideos\n\nFollow Silicon Valley Code Camp on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sv_code_camp\nJoin the Silicon Valley Code Camp G+ community: https://plus.google.com/110656351842726857531\nAsk the Expert: Q&A with Engineering Managers at Silicon Valley Code Camp 2018 \n\n\n\nFollow Ron Lichty on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RonLichty\n\nSpeaker Biography for Ron Lichty\n\nRon Lichty has been managing and, more recently, consulting in managing software development and product organizations for over 25 years. Before that, as a programmer, he coded compiler code generators, was awarded patents for compression and security algorithms he designed and coded for embedded microcontroller devices, wrote two widely used programming texts, and developed the computer animation demo that Apple used to launch and sell a next-generation line of PCs. The primary focus of his consulting practice has mirrored what he did as a manager: untangling the knots in software development. As Ron Lichty Consulting, he takes on fractional Interim VP Engineering and Acting CTO roles, trains teams in scrum, transitions teams to agile, trains managers in managing software people and teams, and advises organizations and coaches teams to make their software development “hum.” His 450-page book, Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams, was recently released as video training - LiveLessons: Managing Software People and Teams - both from Pearson and on O’Reilly’s Safari Network. He also co-authors the biannual Study of Product Team Performance.\n \n\nFollow Mickey W. Mantle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mwmantleCA\n\nSpeaker Biography for Mickey W. Mantle\n\nMickey has been developing software systems and products for over 40 years, as a systems programmer, Tech Lead, Manager, VP Engineering, CTO, COO, and now CEO/CTO of his own company.  During this time he has contributed to several notable companies, including computer graphics pioneer Evans & Sutherland (E&S), Pixar, Broderbund Software, and Gracenote – always in a technical leadership role.\n\nHe continues developing software at Wanderful (see wanderfulstorybooks.com), developing and publishing Apps for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.\n\nWorking with co-author Ron Lichty, they wrote the book “Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams”. Published by Addison Wesley, this book distills their experience of over 70 combined years developing software and managing programmers and has received many accolades including being favorably compared to The Mythical Man Month and Peopleware (see managingtheunmanageable.net).\n \n\nFollow Tammy Baker on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tammybaker123\n\nSpeaker Biography for Tammy Baker\n\nTammy has held a number of executive and management roles over the past 15 years, including vice president of engineering Cantaloupe Systems, vice president of engineering at Untangle, Inc., and vice president of engineering at E-Color. More recently, Tammy is vice president of engineering and CSO for Cantaloupe Systems which was recently acquired by USA Technologies."
